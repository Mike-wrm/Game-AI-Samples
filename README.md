# Game-AI-Samples
A collection of small projects which explore various techniques of game AI. Please see each projects' respective README.txt file for more details. Summaries for each of the projects are as follows:

## A*
<p> A simple implementatioin of the A* pathfinding algorithm, using a grid map (i.e. each node/cell has 4 neighbours).
