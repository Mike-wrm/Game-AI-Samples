// Project: Mini_Maxing
// Status: WIP (Sept 28th/2017)

A simple implementation of connect-4; user deploys white chips, and the computer deploys black chips. The algorithm 
used in this implementation to control where the computer deploys it's chips is alpha-beta pruned Nega-Max. This README file
along with Code_Structure.txt files will be added/updated as this project nears completion.
