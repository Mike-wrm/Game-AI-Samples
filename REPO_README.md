# Game-AI-Samples
The Eclipse workspace above contains several small projects which explore various techniques of game AI. Each project has its own README.txt file, and a collection of Code_Structure.txt files which explain the flow and "not-so-obvious" details of each source code file.

I generally try to use Linux newline characters as much as possible, but there may be some files which accidentily use windows newline characters.
