# Game-AI-Samples
The Eclipse workspace above contains several small Java projects which explore various techniques of game AI. Each project has its own README.txt file, and a collection of Code_Structure.txt files which explain the flow and "not-so-obvious" details of each source code file.

Most of these projects will serve as experiments ("testing the waters", if you will) for AI techniques before they are implemented into Python for the "WAR" project: a pixel-art top-down RPG shooter which is currently a WIP. I generally try to use Linux newline characters as much as possible, but there may be some files which accidentily use windows newline characters.
